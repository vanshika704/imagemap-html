    consists of the southern portion of the larger Kashmir region, 
    which has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947
     and between India and China since 1959.[3] The Line of Control separates Jammu and Kashmir from
      the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and north. 
      It lies to the north of the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and to the west of Ladakh which
       is administered by India as a union territory.
